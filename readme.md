## About
This Discord bot operates, on command, a set of games based on well-known quiz and game show formats; more games will be added, but the current selection includes:
* **Deal or No Deal** - full 26-case game (with Australian money board)
* **Wheel of Fortune** - single-player game with a maximum of five incorrect guesses (at a letter or at solving)

The bot is built upon the [Discord.io library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.io) and Node.js, and is hosted on Heroku as a free dyno.
